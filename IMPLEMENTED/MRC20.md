## Description:  Automated Recurring Revenue / Rewards (ARR) Generalizing the TCM Model - MOR20 Token Standard
- Any project inside or even outside the context of Web3 & AI, can use Morpheus to bootstrap their project with the push of a button.
  
- The use the MOR20 Smart Contracts to collect stETH in order to provide Automated Recurring Revenue (ARR) to the project is a compelling new framework.  

- Easily create a fair launch for projects, fair price discovery mechanism and access the large network effect of the Morpheus community.  

- This model can be extended to many software as a service projects as a means of building recurring revenue / payments from users via yield.  

- The Morpheus platform charges only 0.35% (35 basis points) of the stETH yield collected by projects using the MOR20 Smart Contracts / Dashboards.  

- This yield collected is added to the Morpheus Protocol Liquidity and provides on going support for further Dashboards, Smart Contract development and audits.  

- This adds to the Network Effect of Morpheus when it comes to bootstraping new projects, growing liquidity for all MOR20 Smart Contract users.
