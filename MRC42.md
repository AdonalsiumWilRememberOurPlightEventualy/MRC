## The Time Curve General Description MRC
- The unified Time Curve principle. 
- The answer to "Life, the Universe and Everything" is Time.
- How to making contributions accretive to Morpheus vs extractive. 

## Time Seperates All Things
It seperates the Builders from the tourists. The HODLers from the day traders. 
In the Morpheus context, Time seperates the real Contriubtors from short term opportunists.

**To quote Paul Graham:** 
- "If your opponents are opportunists, one way to beat them is to outlast them. 
- Opportunists almost by definition lack staying power."

## The Time Power Multiple (Shortened "Power")
Rather than pick a "magic" number for the "Time Power Multiple" function, this number can best be set by looking at the actually Dilution Rate the person exeperiences from locking their MOR tokens for a specific period of time.

**For example:**
- On July 15th 2024 2,258,586 MOR will have been emitted.
- On July 15th 2025 7,207,283 MOR will have been emitted.
- In the case the user choses to lock their MOR claims for this 12 month period, they experience 319% dilution.  
- So the Time Power Multiple should be the same. 

- In other words the Base reward as calculated by the number of stETH staked in the case of capital or the weights held in the case of a Code Contributor is mulipled by the Time Power Multiple. 
- The result of this multiplication is then divided by the total stETH * Power or Weights * Power of ALL Contributors in that group to determine the individual Contributors proportionality of the MOR rewards that block.

**For Example:**
- 1 stETH with a 319.07% Power multiple would have a result of 3.19
- This 3.19 sum would be divided by the total stETH staked (or yield provided in a future yield agnostic version) post Power multiple.
- If 100 stETH were already staked the porportion of rewards for the 1 stETH staker after his deposit would be equal to 3.19 out of 103.19 
- Which equals 3.09% of the of the MOR emissions during that block.

## MRCs 38, 39, 40, & 41 
These MRCs stand for how to implement Time as a function for each of the four core proofs of Morpheus. 
Code, Capital, Compute and Builders. However the principle is the same across all four and should hold generally.
