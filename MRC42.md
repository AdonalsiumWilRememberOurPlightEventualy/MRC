# MRC 42

## The Time Curve General Description MRC.
- The unified Time Curve principle. 
- The answer to "Life, the Universe and Everything" is Time.
- How to making contributions accretive to Morpheus vs extractive. 

## Time seperates all things. 
It seperates the Builders from the tourists. The HODLers from the day traders. 
In the Morpheus context, Time seperates the real Contriubtors from all others.

## MRCs 38, 39, 40, and 41 stand for how to implement Time as a function in the four core proofs of Morpheus. 
Code, Capital, Compute and Builders. However the principle is the same across all four and should hold generally.
