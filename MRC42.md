## Time Seperates All Things
It seperates the Builders from the tourists. The HODLers from the day traders. 
In the Morpheus context, Time seperates the real Contriubtors from short term opportunists.

To quote Paul Graham: "If your opponents are opportunists, one way to beat them is to outlast them. Opportunists almost by definition lack staying power."

## MRCs 38, 39, 40, & 41 
These MRCs stand for how to implement Time as a function for each of the four core proofs of Morpheus. 
Code, Capital, Compute and Builders. However the principle is the same across all four and should hold generally.
